#' 
#' This class, we'll be exploring the Card & Krueger data and considering 
#' ways to summarize univariate (or single variable) data. 
#' 
#' Use the ggplot2 cheat sheet for data visualizations: https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization.pdf
#' 
#' ## Read in the Card & Krueger data. 
file <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UChicago-pol-methods/SOSC13200-W23/main/data/card-krueger.csv"
dat <- read.csv(file, as.is = TRUE)

#' Look at the README file for the Card & Krueger data. This will tell you 
#' what is going on with the different variables,and how they're coded. 
#'

#' 

#' First, we'll use subsetting from last class to select the wave 1 and wave 2
#' data
# wave 1 data
dat0 <- dat[which(dat$d==0),]

# wave 2 data
dat1 <- dat[which(dat$d==1),]

#' Use ggplot to look at wage date in wave 1. 
#' 
#' There are three main components to ggplot arguments when producing data 
#' visualizations: data, instructions on aesthetic mappings, and then layers. 
#' You can add multiple layers to the same plot with the same data and mappings. 
ggplot(dat0, # data
       aes(x = wage)) + # aesthetic mapping
  geom_histogram() # layer

#' When you run the last piece of code, we get a warning. 
#' 
#' Should we be worried about the messages/warnings?
#' 
#' It depends on what the warning is telling us. 
#' 
#' Here, it's first giving us a message
#' "` stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`." 
#' 
#' This message is telling us that when we used `geom_histogram()`, ggplot set 
#' the default number of bins in the histogram plot. We can pick our own number of
#' bins that is appropriate for our setting. 
#' 
#' How to decide what the number of bins should be?
#' 
#' One answer could be that we want most unique wage values to be in their own bins. 
#' 
unique(dat0$wage) # we can look at how many unique values of wages there are
sort(unique(dat0$wage))
diff(sort(unique(dat0$wage))) # and find out how far apart unique wage values are

# On average, the distance is about $0.05. 
mean(diff(sort(unique(dat0$wage))))

# If we take the entire range of wages, 
range(dat0$wage, na.rm = TRUE)
# and look at the distance between the lowest and highest value, 
diff(range(dat0$wage, na.rm = TRUE))
# then divide that into length $0.05 pieces, how many pieces do we have?
diff(range(dat0$wage, na.rm = TRUE))/.05
# It's about 30â€”which is the default for histogram bins. So maybe 30 is fine for us. 

#' What about the warning with 20 rows of non-finite values?
#' 
#' That is because some of our wages are stored as missing values. 
table(is.na(dat0$wage))

# We can address the warnings by setting options in the code. 
ggplot(dat0, # data
       aes(x = wage)) + # aesthetic mapping
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, na.rm = TRUE) # layer


#'
#' ## Other options
#' 

# we can set the color of the histogram
ggplot(dat0, # data
       aes(x = wage)) + # aesthetic mapping
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = 'blue', na.rm = TRUE) # layer

# why doesn't it work here? (it's in the aesthetic, not the layer)
ggplot(dat0, # data
       aes(x = wage, fill = 'blue')) + # aesthetic mapping
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, na.rm = TRUE) # layer

# we can look at pa vs. nj wages separately
ggplot(dat0, # data
       aes(x = wage, fill = as.factor(nj))) + # aesthetic mapping
  geom_histogram(bins = 15, position = 'dodge', na.rm = TRUE) # layer

# labelling this in a nicer way
dat0$State <- factor(dat0$nj, labels = c('PA', 'NJ'))

g <- ggplot(dat0, # data
            aes(x = wage, fill = State)) + # aesthetic mapping
  geom_histogram(bins = 15, 
                 position = 'dodge', 
                 color = 'white', 
                 na.rm = TRUE) + # layer
  xlab('Business wages') +
  ylab('Business counts') + 
  ggtitle('Wage by state, counts')

#' Try using different themes. Note that if I save a plot as an object, 
#' I can add different layers to that object and get new plots. 
g + theme_bw()

g + theme_dark()

g + theme_void()

# you can try library(ggthemes) if you want to look up more options


#' 
#' ## Figure 1
#' 
#' I want to re-create Figure 1 from the Card and Krueger paper. 
#' To do that, I'm using the `after_stat()` function to get the y-axis to plot 
#' histograms as a percent *of each state's total*. 
#' 
#' You don't have to worry too much about `after_stat()`, but the below 
#' illustrates how to put pieces of a plot together. 
ggplot(dat0, aes(x = wage, fill = State)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=c(after_stat(count)[after_stat(group)==1]/sum(after_stat(count)[after_stat(group)==1]),
                         after_stat(count)[after_stat(group)==2]/sum(after_stat(count)[after_stat(group)==2]))),
                 position='dodge', bins = 15, na.rm = TRUE) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  theme_bw() + 
  xlab('Business wages') +
  ylab('Percent of businesses') + 
  ggtitle('Wage by state, percentages')



#' 
#' ## Using facet wrap to show the two states side-by-side
g + facet_wrap(~State)

# letting the two plots have different y-axes
g + facet_wrap(vars(State), scales = 'free_y')

# changing how the x-axis is plotted
g + facet_wrap(vars(State), scales = 'free_y')+ 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = -1, hjust = 0.25))


#'
#'  ##  Boxplots
#'  Boxplots are a very useful way to visualize univariate data. 
#'  Here, I have overlayed it with the actual data (with jitters, so I can see every 
#'  data point). 
#'  
#'  A nice data visualization practice is, in addition to any summary plots you 
#'  present, see if you can also present all of the individual data points. 
#'  
#'  Sometimes there are too many data points to do this nicely. 
ggplot(dat0, # data
       aes(x = wage, y = State, fill = State)) +
  geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE, na.rm = TRUE) + 
  geom_jitter(height = 0.2, na.rm = TRUE)


#' What do we see about the range of NJ wages vs. the range of PA wages?
# Looking at this by state (with some extra visualizations thrown in)
dat$State <- factor(dat$nj, labels = c('PA', 'NJ'))

ggplot(dat, # data
       aes(x = wage, y = as.factor(d+1), fill = State, color = State)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("pink", "wheat")) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("grey", "mediumaquamarine")) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, na.rm = TRUE)+
  geom_point(position=position_jitterdodge(), na.rm = TRUE) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(3, 6)) + 
  xlab('Wages') + 
  ylab('Wave') + 
  ggtitle('Wages by wave\nand state')


#' We can also compare the distributions numerically, using the `summarize()` 
#' function. 
# NJ data in wave 1
summary(dat$wage[which(dat$d == 0 & dat$State == 'NJ')])
# NJ data in wave 2
summary(dat$wage[which(dat$d == 1 & dat$State == 'NJ')])


#' Exploring how staffing changes by state and wave
ggplot(dat, # data
       aes(x = mgrs, y = as.factor(d+1), fill = State, color = State)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("pink", "wheat")) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("grey", "mediumaquamarine")) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, na.rm = TRUE)+
  geom_point(position=position_jitterdodge(), na.rm = TRUE) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  xlab('Number of managers') + 
  ylab('Wave') + 
  ggtitle('Number of managers by wave\nand state')

ggplot(dat, # data
       aes(x = pt, y = as.factor(d+1), fill = State, color = State)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("pink", "wheat")) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("grey", "mediumaquamarine")) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, na.rm = TRUE)+
  geom_point(position=position_jitterdodge(), na.rm = TRUE) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  xlab('Number of part time employees') + 
  ylab('Wave') + 
  ggtitle('Number of part time employees\nby wave and state')

ggplot(dat, # data
       aes(x = ft, y = as.factor(d+1), fill = State, color = State)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("pink", "wheat")) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("grey", "mediumaquamarine")) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, na.rm = TRUE)+
  geom_point(position=position_jitterdodge(), na.rm = TRUE) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  xlab('Number of full time employees') + 
  ylab('Wave') + 
  ggtitle('Number of full time employees\nby wave and state')


#' ## Exercises
#' 
#' Run `vignette("ggplot2-specs")` in your console to get an overview of some
#' ggplot2 aesthetics that can be modified. 
#' 
#' 
#' Make a boxplot that shows number of full time equivalent employees by 
#' wave and state. Look up `?geom_boxplot` and modify several different options. 
#' Try seeing what shapes you can use for outliers. 
#' 
#' 
#' Make a histogram that shows number of hours open per day, by co-owned status. 
#' Use colors to show an additional aesthetic component. Try faceting with two 
#' different variables. 
#' 
#' 
#' Recreate one of the boxplots from above, using a violin plot (`geom_violin`).
#' Does this give you different information? See what it looks like overlaying
#' geom_point() or geom_jitter().
