#' This assignment based on analysis in:
#' 
#' Butler, Daniel M., & Broockman, David E. (2011). Do politicians racially 
#' discriminate against constituents? A field experiment on state legislators. 
#' *American Journal of Political Science.* 
#' 
#' # 1.
#'  
#' Go through the replication file for the Butler and Broockman study. 
#' 
#' Replication files are available here:
#' https://isps.yale.edu/research/data/d037
#' 
#' (If you have issues downloading the files, they are also posted on the class
#' GitHub repository.)
#' 
#' You will only need to use the R program file and the Excel .csv file (files 
#' D037F04 and D037F02) respectively, as well as potentially the Stata .dta file 
#' (file D037F01). 
#' 
#' Run the whole replication file in R on your local computer. Note that Michael 
#' used an absolute directory path when he wrote the replication file, you will 
#' need to reset the working directory for your computer or use appropriate 
#' relative file paths. He also used the Stata .dta version of the dataset. You 
#' can use that version and read it in with the appropriate package, or you can 
#' adapt the code to read in the .csv file. 
#' 
#' Once you have run the replication file, write two paragraphs here on your 
#' findings. Was the replication file well written and self explanatory? Or do 
#' you think it should have included more notes for users to understand how to 
#' use it? Interpret some of your findings from the replicated tables.
