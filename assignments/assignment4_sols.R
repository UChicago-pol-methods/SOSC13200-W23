#' Read in the data. We will use the data from:

#' Angrist, Joshua D., and Alan B. Krueger. "Does compulsory school attendance affect schooling and earnings?" The Quarterly Journal of Economics 106.4 (1991): 979-1014.

#' # 1. 
#' Consider Angrist and Kruger (1991) Table III Panel B on p. 996. 
#' We have the data for the 1980 census, for men born 1930-1939--we don't have 
#' the 1920-1929 data, so you can ignore Panel A. 
#' 
#' ## (1a) 
#' Calculate the mean log weekly wage for men born in the first quarter of the 
#' year, and men born in any other quarter of the year. Calculate the 
#' difference, and save the difference as an R object. 

(lnwage1 <- mean(dat$log_weekly_wage[which(dat$quarter_of_birth==1)]))
(lnwage2 <- mean(dat$log_weekly_wage[which(dat$quarter_of_birth!=1)]))
(lnwagediff <- lnwage1 - lnwage2)

#' ## (1b) 
#' Calculate the mean years education for men born in the first quarter of the 
#' year, and men born in any other quarter of the year. Calculate the 
#' difference, and save the difference as an R object. 

(ed1 <- mean(dat$education[which(dat$quarter_of_birth==1)]))
(ed2 <- mean(dat$education[which(dat$quarter_of_birth!=1)]))
(eddiff <- ed1 - ed2)

#' ## (1c) 
#' Calculate the Wald estimate of the returns to education as the ratio of the 
#' difference in mean log earnings by quarter of birth to the difference in 
#' years of mean education by quarter of birth. Compare your results to Table 
#' III Panel B. Are they the same? 

(wald_est <- lnwagediff/eddiff)

#' Interpret the estimate in words. 

# [Your explanation here].

#' # 2.
#' ## (2a)
#' In the Angrist and Krueger data, create a new variable, `year_of_birth_adj`, 
#' which adds a quarter on to year of birth for each quarter in quarter of 
#' birth *after the first quarter*. For example, if a person was born in 1930 Q2, 
#' their `year_of_birth_adj` value would be 1930 + 0.25 * (2-1) = 1930.25. 

dat$year_of_birth_adj <- dat$year_of_birth + 
  0.25 * (dat$quarter_of_birth-1)

#' Then create a new variable, `states_above_16`, which is a 1 when the 
#' the age for compulsory schooling is above 16, and 0 otherwise. Check 
#' Appendix 2 for the list of ages for compulsory school attendance *in 1980*. 
#' Compare this to the values of the place of birth variable in the data set. 
states_above_16 <- c(15, 23, 32, 35, 39, 40, 41, 42, 48, 49, 51, 53)
dat$states_above_16 <- 1 * (dat$place_of_birth %in% states_above_16)

#' ## (2b)
#' Using the `aggregate()` function, group the data set by adjusted year of 
#' birth, quarter of birth, AND whether the state has a compulsory schooling age 
#' above 16, and calculate mean log weekly wage and mean education within 
#' each of the subgroups. Save this as a new data.frame object in R.  
#' 
#' *(Note: you could aggregate just by adjusted year of birth, as this uniquely
#' describes quarters, but I would like you to also have quarter of birth as a 
#' variable in your new dataset.)*
#' 
dat_agg <- aggregate(x = dat[, c('log_weekly_wage', 'education')], 
                     by = list(`year_of_birth_adj` = dat$year_of_birth_adj,

                               `above` = as.factor(dat$states_above_16)),
                     FUN = mean)

#' ## (2c)
#' Create a plot of your aggregated data, using both points and lines, with 
#' adjusted year of birth on the x-axis, and education on the y-axis. Separately
#' plot data for states with compulsory school ages above 16 and for 16 and 
#' below by setting the color in the plot aesthetic.

#' ## (2d)
#' Create a plot of your aggregated data, with education on the x-axis, and 
#' log weekly wages on the y-axis; add a layer for points, and then show a 
#' smoothed line demonstrating the trend across points with 
#' `geom_smooth(method = 'lm')`. Separately plot data for states with compulsory 
#' school ages above 16 and for 16 and below by setting the color in the plot 
#' aesthetic.

#' # 3. 
#' ## (3a)
#' Redo your calculations from question 1, but separately for states with 
#' compulsory school ages above 16 and for 16 and below.

# Final estimates

(wald_est0 <- lnwagediff0/eddiff0)


#' ## (3b)
#' Do you get different estimates for the two conditions? If so, propose an 
#' explanation for why returns to education might be different in these two 
#' cases. If you think the results are not meaningfully different, make a case 
#' for why we should not see a difference.
